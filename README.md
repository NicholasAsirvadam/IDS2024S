## 2.
Local, Centralized, and Distributed
## 3.
Distrubuted is most popular becauase every clone of the central repository with each client is a full backup of the projectâ€™s data and history. Consequently, if the central server/repository fails for any reason, the local repository of the team member that has the most recent clone of the project database can be used to restore the central repository.
## 4.
a. git pull is used to pull the latest project revision from the remote to the local repository.\
\
b. git status is used to check the status of your git project at any time.\
\
c. git add --all is used to add all modified files (including file removals as well as changes) to the staging area.\
\
d. git commit -m"latest build" is used to commit the staged files to the local repository with a short message of "latest build".\
\
e.git push --all is used to push all your commits from the local repository to the remote repository, to place them permanently there and be able to share them with others.
